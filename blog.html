                <h1>Relative size(%,em,rem) and responsive elements.</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>It matters to use relative sizes like percentage(%), em and rem to create
                        responsive elements of a website. It gives it a consistent, non-chaotic, simple
                        type of look to the end user.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These relative lengths are different from the normal absolute lengths because
                        Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative 
                        length units scales better between different rendering mediums.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But absolute lengths units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.
                        Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, 
                        because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used 
                        if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Why are they so important to responsive and modern web pages?
                        the reasons are as mentioned above, the relative lengths consider 
                        all platforms for the website to be veiwed upon any various types of 
                        devices with various sizes and resolutions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Browser capabilities a while ago were tedious, they used to increase the
                        font sizes of every and each charachters individually but nowadays, zooming
                        just mostly adjusting the screen to make it more readable but also not lose its looks.

                <h1>Browsers' interprations of pixels above treshold.</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        The default font-size for browser's is 16px, if font size
                        is not given or set the default value will be used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So what happens when a font-size is set to 200px? How does a browser interprate that?
                        The browser interprates this as if the shown text of 200 pixels is put, meaning
                        it looks like its too zoomed in and kind of hard to read, and the browser doesn't care 
                        about that, it shows it as it is.
                    </p>

                <h1>Changes in CSS3</h1>
                <article>
                    
                
                    <div>
                        <h3>So, what's new with css3?</h3>
                        CSS3 is the latest standard for the CSS language, under development
                        since 2005. It's <a href="">backwards-compatible</a> with older versions
                        of CSS, and has new properties that debug previous quirks and extends
                        CSS2 features, and it's even got some JavaScript-like capabilities.
                        CSS3 has also addressed a number of mobile development concerns, accounting
                        for <a href="">responsive design</a> and making up for issues caused by
                        Adobe Flash incompabilitiy on mobile devices. In combination with JavaScript, 
                        CSS3 has a lot of functionality of Flash now-animation- and iteractivity-wise.
                        <br>
                        Here are seven major things that differentiate CSS3 from its predecessors.
                    </div>
                    
                    <div>
                        <h4>1.Mobile-first mentality</h4>
                        <p>
                            One of the biggest developments is that CSS3 is split into “modules.” All of the old CSS
                            specifications have been migrated over to the new version and divided into smaller pieces (with
                            some new modules added as well).
                        </p>
    
                        <h4>2. Module-based code</h4>
                        <p>
                            CSS3 inherently supports responsive design, and is 
                            equipped to handle media queries. Media queries are calls made by the 
                            code to determine what device and size screen a user is viewing the site on.
                            This adds a whole new responsive design capability to the CSS reportoire.
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <h5>Other CSS3 modules include:</h5>
    
                            <ul id="ul-1">
                                <li>
                                    Selectors: <br>
                                    Developers can edit elements by name, class, type, attribute, and more.
                                </li>
    
                                <li>
                                    The Box Model module:<br> This describes an approach to creating consistency between HTML
                                    elements on a page, or “boxes.” By applying margins, borders, and padding to a box’s content,
                                    developers can clear area around an element, give it borders, and more.
                                </li>
    
                                <li>
                                    Backgrounds and borders:<br> With better control of the treatments of element borders and page
                                    backgrounds, CSS3 also enables rounded corners on boxes and drop shadows. Before CSS3,
                                    backgrounds had to be achieved with images, which added to a page’s file size and load time.
                                </li>
    
                                <li>
                                    Text effects:<br> CSS3 includes shadow effects, text overflow (which hides text that gets too long for
                                    its element), word breaking (automatically breaking text so it fits within a box), and text
                                    wrapping–all things that save designers lots of formatting time.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
    
                        </div>
    
                        <h4>3. Web font support gives designers access to way more than just “web safe” fonts</h4>
                        <p>
                            Before CSS3, designers could only use “web safe” fonts to be 100 percent sure that the fonts
                            would always display the same on everyone’s machine. Web safe fonts are fonts that every
                            single computer has installed and recognizes. If a designer used common fonts like Times New
                            Roman or Arial, they could pretty much guarantee that any user would view their site as it was
                            intended. However, if they wanted to use a rarer font, if it wasn’t supported by a user’s machine,
                            it would default back to a web safe font.
                        </p>
    
                        <h4>4. It enables faster development, and faster load times</h4>
                        <p>
                            What used to require background images, CSS3 can now achieve with visual enhancements,
                            which saves developers time in production. This cuts down on calls and load times for
                            numerous images because these effects are all built into the code. Also, pages load faster
                            thanks to overall smaller file sizes and fewer calls. 
                        </p>
    
                        <h4>5. Create 2D and 3D transformations, animations, and transitions</h4>
                        <p>
                            These effects allow elements on a page to rotate, grow, shrink, flip, or translate into a differentcolor. For the first time, elements created in CSS can move on screen without requiring any
                            JavaScript or Flash code. With transitions, an element can seamlessly change size and color.
                            You can set a duration for a transition, e.g. creating a button that slowly expands and changes
                            color when you mouse over it.
                        </p>
    
                        <h4>6. New colors and image effects</h4>
                        <p>
                            CSS3 supports new colors (RGBA, HSL, HSLA) and gradient colors, and allows for adjustments
                            to opacity. Another biggie is its support of rounded image corners, an effect that required a lot of
                            formatting and Photoshop work to achieve before.
                        </p>
    
                        <h4>7. Box-sizing has fixed some annoying alignment problems</h4>
                        <p>
                            Box-sizing allows developers to get the sizing of elements right without having to subtract
                            dimensions for padding and borders. With the box-sizing property, the padding and border are
                            included in the height and width.
                        </p>
